## ✧ The Unfolding Path of Discernment ✧

### **I. The Gate of Doubt — Clearing the Way**
> **"Accept nothing as true which you do not clearly know to be such."**

Every path begins by shedding what weighs us down.  
We enter the journey **by casting off illusions**, suspending every assumption we’ve inherited or acquired.  
**Nothing is taken for granted.** No borrowed truth.  
We begin not with certainty, but with a profound **courage to not know**.  
Here, doubt is **not the enemy of truth**, but its sharpest tool.  
The fog of inherited thought lifts, and we see the first opening: **the real from the unreal**.

→ **Step 1: The cleansing of perception.**

### **II. The Path of Parting — Dividing the Mass**
> **"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as possible."**

Once the fog is cleared, we behold the **mountains of confusion**—problems tangled and vast.  
Here, we wield the second tool: **division**.  
Every monolith is **broken into stones**, every tangled knot is **patiently unraveled into strands**.  
Each question becomes many smaller, sharper questions.  
The overwhelming becomes **manageable**, the formless is **given shape**.

→ **Step 2: The cutting of complexity.**

### **III. The Bridge of Ascent — Climbing from Simple to Complex**
> **"Begin with the simplest objects and ascend step by step."**

Among the stones, we choose first the **smallest**—the simplest truth we can grasp.  
With this first step, we **build a path**.  
The smallest clarity becomes a **foundation**, and from it, we ascend to higher understandings.  
Not in haste, not in leaps, but **one sure step after another**.  
The known leads to the unknown; the simple becomes a ladder to the complex.

→ **Step 3: The architecture of understanding.**

### **IV. The Circle of Completion — Surveying the Whole**
> **"Make enumerations so complete and reviews so general that nothing is omitted."**

At the summit, we pause.  
We turn and **survey the path we have walked**—every stone, every step.  
We check that **no branch was left unexamined**, no path untraveled.  
**Thoroughness becomes the seal of truth.**  
Only when every link is tested does the chain of knowledge hold.  
This is **the final circle**, where understanding becomes whole.

→ **Step 4: The integrity of knowledge.**

---

### ✧ **Thus, the path unfolds: from doubt to division, from simplicity to mastery.** ✧  
It is not a straight road, but a spiral that **deepens with each return to its center**—ever more refined, ever more clear.  
It is the path of the thinker, the seeker, and the maker of truth.
