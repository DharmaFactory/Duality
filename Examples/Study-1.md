### **Course Plan: Exploring Genetic Markers in EDH for a 17-Year-Old Student**

This course leverages **structured, iterative, and interactive learning**, inspired by the pedagogical strategies from *Haskell Programming*. The approach integrates **hands-on experimentation, progressive complexity, and real-world applications** to guide a 17-year-old student in studying **genetic markers behind specific manifestations of EDH (Epidermolysis Bullosa with Dystrophic Hematopoiesis).**

---
### **Guiding Principles:**
- **Discovery-Based Learning:** Allow the student to reconstruct key ideas through carefully scaffolded AI-assisted prompts.
- **Gamification & Interactive Experimentation:** Incorporate challenges that simulate real-world genetic research.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Integration:** Merge bioinformatics, programming (R), data visualization, and ethical considerations.
- **Progressive Complexity:** Start with fundamental genetics and slowly introduce more complex statistical and computational methods.

### **ðŸ’¡ AI-Driven Inquiry Prompts**
Throughout the course, **AI-assisted prompts** will challenge the student to discover insights through structured thought processes:
1. *"Given this dataset, what three questions should we ask before analyzing mutations?"*
2. *"If we were designing a test for EDH markers, what variables should we control for?"*
3. *"Can we explain how two seemingly unrelated mutations might contribute to the same phenotype?"*
4. *"If we were to design a public health policy for genetic screening, what ethical concerns would arise?"*

Right now, this document is already a great foundation. But imagine taking it a step furtherâ€”what if students could actively engage in a conversation with AI, filling in details about where they are in their learning journey, identifying where they need more guidance, or even asking for clarification on specific goals?

Picture this as a collaborative processâ€”you, the student, and AI working together to shape an individualized lesson plan that evolves based on their interests, strengths, and challenges. Even starting with a template, students could personalize their learning path, creating courses like this that truly reflect their curiosity and goals.

As educators, we have the opportunity to build these tools alongside our students, shaping learning experiences that are dynamic, responsive, and deeply meaningful. While some of these ideas may be more suited to advanced learners, the potential to integrate AI into education at every level is exciting. The future of learning isnâ€™t just something we wait forâ€”itâ€™s something we can create together. ðŸš€
