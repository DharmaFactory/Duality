# ðŸ“… {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} â€” Daily Mantra & Action

## ðŸ“– README â€” How to Use This Template
> This is a **daily mantra + actionable to-do list system** for focused, intentional work.  
> 
> **Tasks** are written as *micro-essays* â€” small sentences that explain both what and why.  
> 
> If a task from a previous day is **unfinished**, **link it here** and create a **clear next step**. Example:  
> 
> - [ ] Finish shading [[2025-03-08#Commission #1 â€” initial sketches]]  
> 
> This way, you create a **living thread of continuity** between days, with each task evolving instead of getting lost or carried over passively.  
> 
> **End the day with reflection** (Kaizen Loop) to feed insights into tomorrowâ€™s plan.  
> 
> **Use tags** for mood, effect, and purpose for easier review and filtering.
