# **→ Purpose of the Meta-Catechism**  
Not to "solve" life.  
Not to "answer" everything.  
But to keep **opening space**—to **unfreeze**, to **become**, to **act**, and to **create new lines of flight**.

These are **questions for threshold moments**—when you are no longer inside the system but standing **outside, looking in**—deciding whether to **re-enter, destroy, rebuild, or transcend**.

Which means, they are questions for the beginner's mind, not someone who already has the answers.
